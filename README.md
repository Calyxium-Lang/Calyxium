3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

4. Run the build script `dune build`

## Getting Started
To start using Calyxium, you need to create a script file with the `.cx` extension. Here's a simple example to get you started:
```
# This is a comment in Calyxium
println("Hello, world");
```
To run your script, use the following command:
`calyxium main.cx`

## Usage
Calyxium is designed to be easy to learn and use. Here are some basic commands and their usage:

- `println("Hello, world!");`: Prints a message to the standard output.
- `let x: int = 10;` Declares a variable `x` and assigns it the value of `int 10`.
- `if (condition) { ... };`: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
